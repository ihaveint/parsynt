(** exec_once : simulate the application of a function body to a set of
    expressions for the state variables. The inputs are replaced by fresh
    variables.
    @raise {e Not_found} if an elemt is missing at some stage of the
    algorithm.

    @param stv the state variable of the function, they have to have the same
    ids as the variables present in the input expressions.
    @param exprs the inital expressions of the state variable before applying
    the function.
    @param func the function that we want to apply to the expressions.
    @param index_expr the index is a special expression not appearing in the
    state nor in the expressions so we have to add it to avoid creating false
    read-only input symbols.

    @return a map of variable ids in the state to the expressions resulting from
    the application of the function to the input variables expressions.
