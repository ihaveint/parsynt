Problems :

General :
- mts-p and mps-p 's joins we proposed previously are not correct. I don't know why the solver
  was able to solve the problem before. But we have to express this problem in a different
  manner. The problem is, if the mps sets back to 0 the position is changed, but the prefix is actually
  the current prefix (not very well explained but.. )

Synthesizing the join :
- average : this "not an application" error appears again. Racket is unable to use the parameter n.
- 0star1star : solution uses the opertor ~ for not. Should add a clause to parse it a not.
- 0after1 : || does not appear in the parsed solution. & used instead of &&.

Compiling the TBB implementation:
- need to add the structure for the example.

Compiling the proof:
- check dependencies to order homomorphisms proofs / functions / joins.
- "requires" dependency collection does not work yet ...
