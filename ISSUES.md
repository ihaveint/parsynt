# Sketch solving
- Sub-optimal use of non-linear operator. We should first try to solve the sketch with arith only, that would be much faster (for example in the plynomial or atoi examples).

# Variable discovery

# TBB example generation
- Auxiliaries that remember just a few elements of the beginning/end of the array chunk are not correctly
handled.
- Parallel assignments problem.
# Proof generation
- Parallel assignments problem: need to figure out in which order the lemmas have to appear.
