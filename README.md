# ConSynth

## Requirements
Most of the source files are written in [Racket 6.4](https://racket-lang.org/download/). You can install Rosette using Racket command line tools :
```$ raco pkg install rosette```
Or you can install it from source, [more information here](https://github.com/emina/rosette).

### OCaml
C code analysis is partially done using the Cil library in Ocaml, so you will need to install Ocaml and some packages.
- Project management : oasis. \\
  ``` opam install oasis ```
- Cil ``` opam install cil ```
